# FileSystem Manager ðŸ§©

The **FileSystem Manager** is responsible for providing comprehensive file and directory management capabilities within the project. 
It offers a set of utilities that allow users to interact with the file system seamlessly through the command-line interface. 
The primary focus of the FileSystem Manager is to simplify operations like directory navigation, file inspection, and directory creation.

**Key Responsibilities**

1. **Directory Navigation**:
    - The FileSystem Manager enables users to navigate through the directory structure effortlessly. It provides basic commands to list, change, and manage directories within the project environment.
    - Commands include:
        - ``` ls [path] ```: Lists the contents of a directory. If no path is provided, it lists the current working directory. It displays files and subdirectories along with their metadata;
        - ``` cd <directory> ```: Allows the user to change the current working directory. It supports relative and absolute paths, helping users quickly switch to different directories.
2. **File and Directory Inspection**:
    - Users can inspect files and directories using the ``` look <file> ``` command, which displays detailed information about a file or directory. This includes metadata such as size, modification date, and type;
    - This feature is essential for obtaining quick insights into file properties and ensuring that files are correctly identified before running operations on them.
3. **Directory Creation**:
    - The FileSystem Manager allows users to create new directories with the ``` mkdir <dir> ``` command.
      This utility ensures that directories are created in the correct location within the file system and checks for any errors (e.g., if the directory already exists);
    - It provides feedback to the user, confirming whether the directory creation was successful or if there were any issues.
4. **File and Directory Path Autocompletion**:
    - The FileSystem Manager supports real-time file and directory path autocompletion, helping users complete file paths or commands by pressing the ``` Tab ``` key;
    - This autocompletion feature speeds up navigation and file handling by suggesting available files or directories based on the userâ€™s input.
6. **File System Command Execution**:
    - In addition to basic navigation and inspection, the FileSystem Manager integrates with the broader project command system to run filesystem-related operations as part of the larger toolset;
    - This includes executing shell-like commands for file system interaction, directly from the console interface.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI) Integration**

The FileSystem Manager integrates tightly with the **ConsoleUtils** module, providing an interactive user experience through the CLI. 
Features like command history, tab completion, and real-time error handling are embedded in the file system operations, making it easy for users to work with files and directories without needing to exit the CLI.

**Console Interaction Flow**

- **Tab Completion**: Users can autocomplete file paths and directory names within the CLI by pressing Tab. This feature reduces the need for typing full file or directory names, especially in complex file structures;
- **Real-time Feedback**: All file and directory operations provide immediate feedback to the user, whether it's listing a directoryâ€™s contents, changing directories, or creating new directories.
  This ensures that users are always aware of the state of the file system.

**Integration with Other Components**

The FileSystem Manager works in tandem with other parts of the project, such as the **Local Repository Manager**, which relies on file system operations for creating and managing repositories locally. 
The flexibility of the FileSystem Manager also allows it to handle complex directory structures commonly associated with Git repositories.

By combining efficient directory navigation, file inspection, and seamless integration with the console, the FileSystem Manager serves as a robust tool for users managing both individual files and larger directory structures within their projects.
