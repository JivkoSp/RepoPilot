# Shell Project Structure ðŸ§©

The **Shell Project Structure** of RepoPilot defines the organization of core functionalities, managers, services, and utilities that collectively create a robust and extensible shell environment. 
This modular architecture ensures that each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the application, promoting maintainability, scalability, and ease of development.

1. **Overview**

    RepoPilotâ€™s architecture is divided into four main directories:
    - **Core**: Contains fundamental modules that handle alias management, file system operations, and the main shell loop;
    - **Managers**: Houses modules responsible for managing higher-level tasks such as local repositories;
    - **Services**: Includes modules that interact with external services like GitHub and manage user interactions;
    - **Utils**: Provides utility functions and command executors that support core and manager modules.

    This structured approach ensures clear separation of concerns, making the project easier to navigate, extend, and maintain.
   
2. **Core Components**

    The **Core** directory encompasses the essential modules that form the backbone of RepoPilotâ€™s shell environment. These modules manage aliases, handle file system operations, and control the main shell loop.

    **/RepoPilot/Core/AliasManager**

    The **AliasManager** handles the creation, modification, listing, and removal of command aliases.
    It allows users to define shortcuts for frequently used commands, enhancing productivity and reducing repetitive typing.

    Responsibilities:
    - **HandleAliasCommand**: Manages alias operations based on user input, including listing current aliases, adding new ones, and removing existing aliases;
    - **Alias Storage**: Maintains an in-memory dictionary of aliases that can be persisted across sessions by integrating with shell configuration files.

    **Key Method**:
    ```html
      public static void HandleAliasCommand(ref Dictionary<string, string> aliases, string[] args)
    ```

    **/RepoPilot/Core/FileSystemManager**

    The **FileSystemManager** is responsible for managing file system operations within the shell.
    It provides functionalities such as listing directory contents, changing directories, creating directories, and inspecting files.

    Responsibilities:
    - **ListDirectoryContents**: Lists files and directories with enhanced formatting and color-coded output;
    - **ChangeDirectory**: Changes the current working directory based on user input;
    - **MakeDirectory**: Creates new directories, supporting nested directory creation;
    - **LookCommand**: Displays detailed information about specified files, including size, permissions, and last accessed time.

    **Key Methods**:
     ```html
      public static void ListDirectoryContents(string currentDirectory, string[] args)
      public static void ChangeDirectory(ref string currentDirectory, string[] args)
      public static void MakeDirectory(string currentDirectory, string[] args)
      public static void LookCommand(string fileName)
     ```

    **/RepoPilot/Core/Shell**

    The **Shell** class serves as the main loop for the command-line interface.
    It processes user input, executes commands, manages command history, and coordinates interactions between different modules.

    Responsibilities:
    - **Run**: Initiates the shell loop, handling user input and command execution;
    - **RunPilotCommandAsync**: Executes custom pilot commands for managing repositories and interactions;
    - **LoadCommandHistory & SaveCommandHistory**: Manage the persistence of command history across sessions.

    **Key Methods**:
    ```html
      public async Task Run()
      public async Task RunPilotCommandAsync(string arguments)
      private void LoadCommandHistory()
      private void SaveCommandHistory()
      private void RunExternalCommand(string command, string arguments)
    ```
    
3. **Managers**

5. **Utilities**

    The **Utils** directory contains helper modules that provide general-purpose functionality, such as executing Git commands and managing the shellâ€™s console output.
    These utilities support the core components and managers by offering reusable logic that simplifies complex operations.

    **/RepoPilot/Utils/ConsoleUtils**

    The **ConsoleUtils** module enhances the console experience by providing utilities for setting the console font, printing banners, and handling input with tab completion and command history.

    ```
    
6. **Interactions and Workflow**

    The **Shell** component orchestrates interactions between Core components, Managers, Services, and Utilities to provide a cohesive command-line experience.

    **Workflow Example: Creating an Alias**
    - **User Input**: The user types ``` alias gs='git status' ``` in the shell;
    - **Shell Processing**: The ``` Shell ``` class parses the command and delegates it to the AliasManager;
    - **Alias Handling**: The ``` AliasManager ``` updates the in-memory alias dictionary and persists it by suggesting saving to the shell configuration file;
    - **Command Execution**: When the user later types ``` gs ```, the ``` Shell ``` recognizes it as an alias and expands it to ``` git status ```, executing it via the ``` GitCommandExecutor ```;
    - **Feedback**: Output from the command is formatted and displayed using ``` ConsoleUtils ```.

    **Workflow Example: Managing Branches**
    - **User Input**: The user types ``` pilot manage branches ```;
    - **Shell Processing**: The ``` Shell ``` class delegates the command to the ``` LocalRepositoryManager ```;
    - **Branch Management**: The ``` LocalRepositoryManager ``` interacts with the ``` GitCommandExecutor ``` and ``` GitHubService ``` to perform branch operations;
    - **Feedback**: ``` UserInteraction ``` provides prompts and displays results using ``` ConsoleUtils ```.
