# Git Command Integration ðŸ§©

RepoPilot is designed to streamline Git workflows by integrating common Git commands directly into its shell environment. This seamless integration allows users to manage their repositories efficiently without needing to switch between 
different tools or interfaces. Below is a detailed breakdown of the Git command integration features within RepoPilot.

1. **Core Git Commands**
   RepoPilot supports a wide range of core Git commands, enabling users to perform essential version control tasks directly within the custom shell.
   The integration ensures compatibility with existing Git configurations, making it a flexible solution for managing repositories.
   
   **Supported Commands**:
   - ``` git status ```: Displays the state of the working directory and staging area. Users can see which files are modified, staged for commit, or untracked;
   - ``` git add ```: Adds files to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit. The shell supports adding individual files or all changes (git add .);
   - ``` git commit ```: Records changes in the local repository. RepoPilot provides interactive commit message prompts, allowing users to easily document their changes;
   - ``` git pull ```: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch. This keeps the local branch up to date with the latest changes from collaborators;
   - ``` git push ```: Uploads local commits to a remote repository. RepoPilot automates the push process for branches, helping users quickly share their changes;
   - ``` git branch ```: Lists, creates, renames, and deletes branches. RepoPilot makes it easy to manage local and remote branches directly from the shell;
   - ``` git checkout ```: Switches between branches or restores specific files. This command allows for easy branch management and file recovery;
   - ``` git merge ```: Merges changes from one branch into another, helping users integrate updates from feature or development branches into the main branch.
3. **Branch Management**
   - RepoPilot simplifies branch management through intuitive Git command integration. Users can create new branches, switch between branches, and delete branches directly from the shell;
   - Branch Creation: With ``` git branch ``` and ``` git checkout -b ```, users can create new branches for feature development or bug fixes, keeping their main branch clean and stable;
   - Branch Switching: The ``` git checkout ``` command allows for seamless switching between branches, helping users work on multiple tasks in parallel;
   - Branch Deletion: The ``` git branch -d ``` command is supported for deleting merged branches, ensuring that the repository remains clean and organized.
4. **Commit Management**
   - RepoPilot enhances the process of managing commits through interactive prompts and helpful output. The shell provides clear guidance during the commit process, ensuring that users accurately document their changes;
   - Interactive Commit Messages: When running ``` git commit ```, RepoPilot prompts users to enter a commit message, ensuring that changes are well-documented. The shell can also support multi-line commit messages for more detailed descriptions;
   - Amending Commits: The ``` git commit --amend ``` command allows users to modify the most recent commit, making it easy to correct mistakes or add new changes before pushing.
5. **Stashing and Reverting Changes**
   - RepoPilot integrates Git's powerful change management tools, such as stashing and reverting, to help users manage uncommitted changes efficiently;
   - Stashing Changes: The ``` git stash ``` command saves uncommitted changes for later use, allowing users to switch branches or perform other tasks without losing their work;
   - Applying Stashes: The ``` git stash apply ``` command restores previously stashed changes, enabling users to continue where they left off;
   - Reverting Commits: With ``` git revert ```, users can undo specific commits by creating a new commit that reverses the changes. This feature is helpful for reverting problematic updates while preserving the overall commit history.
6. **Conflict Resolution**
   - RepoPilot assists users in handling merge conflicts by providing clear and concise output when conflicts arise during operations like ``` git merge ``` or ``` git pull ```;
   - Conflict Identification: The shell displays detailed information about the conflicting files and lines, helping users quickly identify the issues;
   - Conflict Resolution Assistance: RepoPilot offers step-by-step guidance on resolving conflicts, including editing files, staging the resolved changes, and committing the result.
7. **Remote Repository Management**
   - RepoPilot integrates Git's remote management commands, enabling users to interact with repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket;
   - Cloning Repositories: The ``` git clone ``` command allows users to copy remote repositories to their local machines, providing a starting point for collaboration or development;
   - Fetching Updates: With ``` git fetch ```, RepoPilot users can retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging them, giving them the flexibility to review updates before applying them;
   - Pulling and Pushing: The ``` git pull ``` and ``` git push ``` commands are integrated into the shell to synchronize local repositories with remotes. RepoPilot ensures that users can easily pull the latest changes and push their work upstream.
8. **Tagging**
   - RepoPilot allows users to create and manage Git tags, which are helpful for marking specific points in the repository's history, such as version releases;
   - Creating Tags: With ``` git tag ```, users can create lightweight or annotated tags, marking important milestones in the repository;
   - Pushing Tags: The shell supports pushing tags to remote repositories, ensuring that tags are shared with collaborators.
9. **Log Viewing and History**
   - RepoPilot provides users with access to Git's logging and history features, enabling them to review past commits, changes, and branches;
   - Viewing Commit History: The ``` git log ``` command shows a detailed history of commits, including author information, commit messages, and timestamps;
   - Filtering Logs: Users can filter logs by specific criteria, such as author or date, using options like ``` git log --author ``` or ``` git log --since ```.
10. **Interactive GitHub Integration**
    - RepoPilot enhances Git's core functionality with interactive GitHub integration, allowing users to interact with GitHub repositories directly from the shell;
    - Repository Creation: Users can create new repositories on GitHub without leaving the RepoPilot shell, streamlining the process of initializing and pushing new projects;
    - Branch and Pull Request Management: RepoPilot supports managing branches and pull requests on GitHub, helping users collaborate more effectively with their teams.
