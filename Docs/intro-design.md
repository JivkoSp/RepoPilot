# Overall Design üõ†Ô∏è

RepoPilot is designed with simplicity, extensibility, and user experience in mind, combining essential Git operations with GitHub integration into a unified command-line tool. 
The overall architecture is modular, allowing for clear separation of concerns, and it adheres to principles of maintainability and ease of use. Below is an overview of the key design elements:

1. **Modular Architecture**
   RepoPilot is organized into several distinct components, each handling specific responsibilities. This modular approach enhances code maintainability, testability, and future extensibility.
   The key modules are:
   - **Command Management**: Handles user input, command parsing, and command execution. This module routes different Git and GitHub commands to their respective handlers;
   - **Git Operations Module**: Contains all local Git-related operations such as creating branches, committing changes, and managing repositories;
   - **GitHub Service Module**: Integrates with the GitHub API for remote operations such as repository creation, managing branches, and pushing commits;
   - **User Interaction Module**: Provides mechanisms for user input, command prompts, and displaying help documentation.
2. **Git Command Executor**
   The Git Command Executor acts as an abstraction over native Git commands. It runs shell commands in the background to perform actions such as:
   - **Initializing repositories**
   - **Switching branches**
   - **Merging branches**
   - **Viewing commit history**
  This module is designed to simplify interacting with Git, providing feedback to users through a unified interface.
3. **GitHub Integration**
   RepoPilot integrates directly with GitHub via the GitHub API. This is encapsulated in the ``` GitHubService ``` class, which provides a layer of abstraction over common GitHub actions.
   Features include:
   - **Token Management**: Ensures users can store and retrieve GitHub access tokens securely;
   - **Repository Management**: Provides functionality to create, delete, and manage GitHub repositories;
   - **Remote Branch Management**: Handles creating, deleting, and viewing remote branches on GitHub, synchronized with the local repository.
4. **Shell Environment**
  RepoPilot features a custom shell-like environment where users can interact with the system. The shell environment has the following characteristics:
  - **Path Management**: Users can navigate through directories and interact with their file systems;
  - **Command History**: Stores previously executed commands and allows users to scroll through them;
  - **Alias Support**: Users can define aliases for frequently used commands, optimizing their workflow.
5. **User Interaction and Help System**
  RepoPilot prioritizes user-friendly interaction. It prompts users with clear instructions when input is required and provides helpful error messages when something goes wrong.
  Additionally, the built-in help system provides:
  - **Detailed Help Commands**: Displays descriptions for all available commands and their usage;
  - **Command Suggestions**: Guides users by suggesting the next possible actions or commands in an intuitive way.
6. **File System Management**
  RepoPilot‚Äôs file system management capabilities allow users to easily navigate and manipulate files and directories.
  These functions are handled through the ``` FileSystemManager ``` class, which:
  - **Lists directory contents**
  - **Changes directories**
  - **Creates directories**
  - **Provides file details** (size, last accessed date, and whether it is executable)
  This feature enhances RepoPilot‚Äôs utility beyond basic Git commands, making it a more complete terminal experience.
7. **Error Handling and Reporting**
  RepoPilot has built-in error handling across all modules, ensuring that the user experience remains smooth.
  If an error occurs, it provides:
  - **Descriptive Error Messages**: When operations fail, RepoPilot returns specific error details to the user, helping them understand what went wrong;
  - **Recovery Paths**: In some cases, RepoPilot suggests corrective actions users can take to resolve issues.
8. **Extensibility**
  The design of RepoPilot allows for future extensions and modifications with ease. New Git commands, services, or even external tools can be added by:
  - **Adding New Command Handlers**: The modular command system allows new commands to be implemented and plugged in without affecting other components;
  - **Expanding GitHub API Integration**: Additional GitHub operations (e.g., pull requests, issues) can be incorporated into the existing GitHubService module by expanding the API usage.

RepoPilot‚Äôs design focuses on creating a smooth and intuitive workflow for developers managing their local and remote repositories. 
The combination of a shell environment, seamless GitHub integration, modular components, and helpful user interaction makes RepoPilot an efficient tool for developers of all skill levels.
